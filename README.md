# Col-Echo: An online open-mic platform
Col-Echo aims to provide a place for artists of all disciplines to share their work-in-progress with other artists for feedback. Or share an experiment only true artists would appreciate. 

## Consistancy
What is unique about Col-Echo is that posts are limited to once per month per artist to emphasize consistency, and build anticipation for fans.

Furthermore monthly posts are softly enforced to keep the artist accountable and engaged in their craft. If an artist doesn’t post to Col-Echo in a given month, the app will post for them (with an automated or custom message) so their followers know they didn’t post that month. Col-Echo is an open mic platform, not a place to release completed work. If it’s not ready for the public that’s okay! The community understands and will support your growth.

## Community
Fans and fellow artists will comment on your work with constructive feedback. You’ll be able to post feedback to other artists you follow. Col-Echo fosters a safe space to experiment and try new approaches to your craft before releasing to “the public”.
